[36m[npx] virmator [--flags] command subCommand [...optional args][0m

-   [36mnpx[0m is needed when the command is run directly from the terminal (not called from
    within an npm script) unless virmator has been globally installed (which I recommend against).
-   [36m[--flags][0m is any of the optional virmator flags. See Virmator Flags below.
-   [36mcommand[0m, [36msubCommand[0m, and [36m[...optional args][0m depend on the specific
    command you're running. See Available Commands below.
